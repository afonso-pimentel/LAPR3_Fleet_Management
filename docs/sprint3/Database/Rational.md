## Justification of selecting Oracle relational database


One would choose a relational database over any other type of database for the following reasons:
* A Relational Database has a simple model easy to understand.
* Helps in maintaining data integrity.
* Improves data accuracy.
* Reduces data redundancy to a minimum.
* Data scalability.
* Data flexibility and facilitates implementation of some modifications.
* Normalization helps breaking down the data using NF1, NF2, NF3...

And these characteristics suit the needs of this project.
As for the software, we will use Oracle as it is provided by the institute and made available through docker containers.
